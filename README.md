# A guide for K2ge3 TrollStore Installation

## Attention
If you sideload LINE with methods other than TrollStore(free/paid apple account or enterprise cert), LINE won't work correctly and you may lose access to your account.<br>
Please don't change the bundle identifier from jp.naver.line as it doesn't support duplicating. <be>
Please refer to [this site](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/) for supported versions & installation methods of TrollStore.<br>
Moreover, I recommend you to back up your data through AppsManager or backup the chat history & enable account transfer mode beforehand. (Basically, your data will be retained if you re-download the app from AppStore even if you encounter issues)
 
## Installation

Download the ipa that contains K2ge3 from [this page](https://github.com/m4fn3/k2ge3-trollstore/releases/latest)<br>* For advanced users, you may get the latest deb of the tweak [here](https://github.com/m4fn3/repo/tree/master/debs) and inject into preferred ipa<br>* Keep in mind that K2ge3 v1.0.3 or higher is required to work on TrollStore.
2. Install the ipa through TrollStore<br>* If you have already installed LINE from AppStore, you can retain the app data by overwriting the app<br>* If you want to revert to the original app, You can do so from AppStore
