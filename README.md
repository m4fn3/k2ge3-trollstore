# A guide for K2ge3 TrollStore Installation

## Attention
If you sideload LINE with methods other than TrollStore(free/paid apple account or enterprise cert), LINE won't work correctly and you may lose access to your account.<br>
Please refer to [this site](https://ios.cfw.guide/installing-trollstore/) for supported versions & installation methods of TrollStore.<br>
Moreover, I recommend you to back up your data through AppsManager etc beforehand.

## Installation
1. Download the ipa that contains K2ge3 from [this page](https://github.com/m4fn3/k2ge3-trollstore/releases/latest)<br>* For advanced users, you may get the latest deb of the tweak [here](https://github.com/m4fn3/repo/tree/master/debs) and inject into preferred ipa<br>* Keep in mind that K2ge3 v1.0.3 or higher is required to work on TrollStore.
2. Install the ipa through TrollStore<br>* If you have already installed LINE from AppStore, you can retain the app data by overwriting the app<br>* If you want to revert to the original app, You can do so from AppStore
3. Open Tweak settings that can be found on settings in the LINE app.
4. When you use the tweak for the first time, please enter your license key and activate the tweak.
